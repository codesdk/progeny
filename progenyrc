[paths]
#
# Defining "footprints"
#
# "footprints" refers
# to the path where you store custom project footprints, Progeny will look
# here first and if the desired language/type combo is not found, will revert
# to the defaults.
footprints: $HOME/.config/progeny/footprints

#
# Defining "parent"
#
# "parent" refers to the default parent directory of your projects. If
# "parent is not defined here, Progeny will expect to be called with the '-p'
# argument else it will raise an error. When a "parent" is supplied, Progeny
# will append the app_name (supplied via command line argument '-n' or '--name')
# to the "parent" path, 
#
# e.g: parent: /home/user/projects
# $ progeny -n app_name
#
# results in: /home/user/projects/app_name
parent: $HOME/projects

[project defaults]

# Your name. What you call yourself or wish others called you. This gets populated
# in README.md files automatically.
author: Me

# Your preferred email address for contact. This gets populated in README.md
# files automatically.
email: mine@not.yours

# The programming/scripting language for which you primarily create projects.
# Valid values are those which correspond to either the default footprints,
# your custom footprints, or both.  
#
# Footprints are excepted to be store in 
# parent -> language -> type hierarchies, e.g: ~/projects/python/cli
# 
# If you've defined "footprints" in the "Paths" section above and decided to name a
# language "lol++" in that path, and that's the primary language you work in, then put
# "lol++" in this field (without the quotes).
language: go

# The type of project for which you primarily create projects.
# As above, the "type" of project is relevant to the "footprints" path set
# in the "Paths" section and Progeny expects footprints to be in a 
# parent -> language -> type hierarchy (see the example in the language section).
#
# If you've defined "footprints" in the "Paths" section above and decided to name
# a type "derp" and that's the type of project you primarily work in, put "derp" here
# (without the quotes).
type: cli

# Your preferred license. Progeny will attempt to download the license
# in order to populate the LICENSE file and will also auto-populate README.md
# files' "license" section with this value.
license: gpl2
